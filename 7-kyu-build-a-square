    # need to return 'shape' - but in fact + on each line
    # based on the parameter from 1 to 50
    # first answer how can you make a single "+" - done
    # n*n - number of total n's needed - done
    # need to make n's to '+' - done
    # then every nth you need to add \n - line break - done
    # lastly we need to strip the final line break with strip
